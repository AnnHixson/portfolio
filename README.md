Clicking on the various tabs at the top will open the different pages. On the 'Portfolio' page, below each project is a link to the deployed site, the GitHub repo, and a description of the project. On the 'Contact Me' page, clicking on the links will open my GitHub profile or LinkedIn. On the 'Resume' page, clicking on the link will open a PDF of my resume.
