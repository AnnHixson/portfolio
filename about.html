                My name is Ann Hixson. I have a Bachelor's Degree in Cognitive Science from the University of Connecticut (UCONN). In my studies, I particularly enjoyed and excelled at both symbolic logic (Philosophy) and syntax (Linguistics). This love of problem solving and logical thinking prompted me to look into computer programming. To that end, I recently completed a six month long intensive Coding Boot Camp with the UCONN School of Engineering.
                My natural attention to detail and a strong mind for logic worked in my favor and kept me enjoying the coursework. By the end of the course, I was ready to take on a new challenge - game logic. I convinced my group to choose my project idea - online checkers - and I took on the entirety of the game logic for our site. Those 3,000+ lines of code earned me the kudos of the instructional team. Now I am ready to seek further challenges as a problem-solving programmer.
